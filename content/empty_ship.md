A monk decides to meditate alone, away from his monastery.    
He takes his boat out to the middle of the lake.  
He closes his eyes and begins his meditations.  

The polluted waters cloud his mind   
and the industrial fishing his ears.  
He decides to build a spaceship.  

Meditating in deep space, he suddenly feels a crash.  
The astronaut monk senses his anger rising.  
He boards his now-neighbor's ship, ready to scream. 

But when he goes inside, he sees it is empty,  
a stranded ship lost to time.  

At that moment, the monk achieves self-realization;  
anger is within him,   
provoked out even by the slightest of bumps.

If you can empty your own spaceship  
crossing the galaxy of life,  
no one will oppose you,  
no one will seek to harm you.
